I will be leaving notes on testing approach, including plans, bugs, etc.

Will update with proper formatting when finished.

• forked repo, opened in VSCode
• installed and updated npm (make sure to specify in bash)

• installed playwright, ran example tests

• figuring stuff out using playwright codegen
• important: run npm run dev before trying to run playwright tests
• filtering by UI and URL (first objective), works in Chromium and Firefox but not WebKit?

• KNOWN ISSUE: TESTS WORK FINE ON CHROMIUM AND FIREFOX, BUT NOT SAFARI, SAFARI HAS PROBLEMS FILTERING BY DATE: Error: Invalid date string: 2024-10-29 12:30:06.5450270 -05:00
